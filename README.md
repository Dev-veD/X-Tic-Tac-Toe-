# X-Tic-Tac-Toe-
I bet you cannot beat this game of tic-tac-toe
This is implementation of MINMAX algorithm using Tic_Tac_Toe game.

This Game Never Lets Opponent Win As Its better to draw and it has an option to draw and if both players play optimally then game will always end up in a draw.


If you do not make optimal choice game will tease you with a message .....

Im Thinkng that why do we even need to have a win message for the user as he is never gonna win.
